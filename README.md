# Type Type Revolution
This game is like Guitar Hero, but there are letters in place of glowing
colored circles, and combos are made of words, not just by holding a button
down.
 
## Building
### Automatically
Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to open up `org.codecentral.type.TTRGame.java`
in the `src` directory. Click the green run button that appears in the 
side gutter.

### Manually
Use the javac compiler to compile the sources:
```bash
javac -sourcepath src -d out/
```

To run, use the java CLI:
```bash
java out/org.codecentral.type.TTRGame
```
